# Flash Card App Project

This Python application utilizes the tkinter library to create an interactive flashcard learning tool for French vocabulary. 
Users can learn new words by flipping cards to see the English translation and can track their progress by marking words as known.

## Key Features

**Flashcard Interface:**
  - The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can view French words on one side of the card and their English translations on the other side.

**Random Word Selection:**
  - The app randomly selects a word from the list of French vocabulary words to display on the flashcard, ensuring a varied learning experience.

**Card Flipping Mechanism:**
  - The flashcard automatically flips after a set duration (3 seconds) to reveal the English translation, enhancing the learning process.

**Tracking Known Words:**
  - Users can mark words as known, which removes them from the list of words to learn. The updated list is saved to a CSV file for future sessions.

**Data Management with CSV:**
  - The application reads from a CSV file containing French vocabulary words and their English translations. If the file is not found, it uses a default set of words

**User Interaction with Buttons:**
  - The application includes buttons for users to indicate whether they know the word or not, allowing for interactive learning.
